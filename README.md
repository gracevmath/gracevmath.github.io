## Projects

### **Tableau**

#### **Border Crossings**

I took Border Crossing Data from Data.gov collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. I took this data and created a dashboard on Tableau that shows various dimensions of this data. From this dashboard, conclusions can be seen clearly or used to do further analysis.

### **MATLAB**

#### **Substitute Teacher Pool**
  
I took a project prompt from **A First Course in Mathematical Modeling: Third Edition** by Frank R. Giordano, Maurice D. Weir, and William P. Fox. I used the data given and created a program to test and re-test values for sample size using MATLAB. I then wrote up a report that showed the results of each test and my conclusions thereafter.

### **R**

#### **Walking Analysis**

I took already cleaned data from a study comparing walking styles and how energy efficient these "silly" walking styles were. I completed a full analysis of this data and looked at a specific character's data compared with other measures included in the data. I then compiled a report stating my findings and including the analyses I completed using R.
